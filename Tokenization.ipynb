      "[1] [2] [3] While nearly all salad greens have some health benefits to offer, they can differ somewhat in the type and amount of fiber, vitamins, and minerals they contain, says Kelly Kennedy, RDN, the staff nutritionist for Everyday Health. Getting a variety of leafy greens in your diet is a good strategy to take advantage of the health benefits they have to offer. Read on for our ranking of 14 salad greens, including nutritional information, why they’re healthy, and some meal prep ideas. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 31.1 Carbs: 1 gram (g) Fiber: 0.8 g Protein: 0.6 g [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] \"Kale is delicious raw or cooked,\" says Kennedy. \"It's simple to prepare sautéed with some onions and garlic, amazing baked into 'chips,' and makes a great base for a salad.\" For the salad, if you chop the kale into small pieces or allow it to sit in the dressing for a little bit before eating (or both), it becomes more tender, she explains. Kale also pairs well with roasted squash, nuts, seeds, and beans. \"However you serve kale, just be sure to remove the tough ribbing first,\" Kennedy says Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 7 Carbs: 1 g Fiber: 0.7 g Protein: 1 g [10] [11] “Spinach makes a great salad base,” says Kennedy. “What I love about having spinach on hand is that it can easily be incorporated into so many dishes without ‘taking over’ flavorwise. It’s excellent on top of a sandwich, stirred into an omelet, and sautéed in olive oil.” Alternatively, pair spinach with strawberries, balsamic, and a sprinkle of feta cheese for a flavor-packed salad. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 8 Carbs: 2 g Fiber: 1.4 g Protein: 1 g [12] “Beet greens can be eaten raw or prepared in the same way as spinach or kale. Try sautéing them with olive oil, garlic, and onions,” says Kennedy. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 7 Carbs: 1 g Fiber: 0.6 g Protein: 1 g [13] “Swiss chard has a distinct flavor that not everyone appreciates,” says Kennedy. “It tastes great sautéed with garlic and onions and mixes into a quiche or frittata well. If you’ve tried it one way and didn’t like it, try cooking it a different way — you may be surprised!” Consider combining chard with a few other greens to make your own mix. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 25 Carbs: 5 g Fiber: 1.9 g Protein: 2 g [14] “Dandelion greens are excellent in a salad and can also be sautéed and enjoyed warm,” says Kennedy. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 15 Carbs: 3 g Fiber: 1.8 g Protein: 2 g [15] “Mustard greens are excellent raw with oil and vinegar and also sautéed with olive oil and herbs,” says Kennedy. Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 12 Carbs: 2 g Fiber: 1.4 g Protein: 1 g [16] “If you’re not used to preparing collard greens, you’ll be surprised by how easy they are to cook,” says Kennedy. “Simply sauté them in olive oil, and allow them to simmer for about 45 minutes. Collard greens take longer to cook than other greens but are worth the wait! They taste great raw, too.” Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 4 Carbs: 0 g Fiber: 0.2 g Protein: 1 g [17] “Watercress makes a delicious addition to a salad, and if you love its peppery flavor, it can even be enjoyed alone with just a touch of oil and vinegar,” says Kennedy. “Watercress can also be pureed into a soup for an extra dose of flavor and nutrition.” Portion: 1 cup shredded Calories: 5 Carbs: 1 g Fiber: 0.05 g Protein: 0.05 g [18] “Romaine lettuce has a great crunch and is delicious served in a salad or on top of a sandwich,” says Kennedy. “Romaine can even be lightly grilled for a unique, slightly charred flavor.” To boost the nutritional value of your salad, mix romaine with some spinach or kale to pack in more antioxidants, or opt for a premixed blend. “Prepackaged salad green mixtures offer a wide variety of nutrients without you having to buy large quantities of each type of green,” says Kennedy. Tossing your salad greens with a small amount of healthy oil is also a great idea, as the oil adds a dose of healthy fat (and flavor) and can also improve your body’s absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the salad, she adds. Portion: 1 cup shredded Calories: 5 Carbs: 1 g Fiber: 0.5 g Protein: 0 g [19] “Most people know that red and green lettuce can be served in a salad or on top of a sandwich, but it’s also delicious sautéed, steamed, or grilled,” says Kennedy. Like many salad greens, it’s a little low in fiber, though, so bulk up your salad with higher-fiber veggies such as broccoli, carrots, and legumes, Kennedy recommends. Portion: 1 cup shredded Calories: 7 Carbs: 1 g Fiber: 0.6 g Protein: 1 g [20] “Also great as a salad or on top of a sandwich, the size of these lettuce leaves makes them a great bread replacement for anyone looking to go low-carb,” says Kennedy. “You can make a traditional sandwich and serve it on butter lettuce, or even roll the ingredients inside the leaves to create a sort of ‘wrap’ in place of a tortilla.” Portion: 1 cup raw Calories: 8 Carbs: 2 g Fiber: 1.6 g Protein: 0.6 g [21] Meal Prep Inspo “Endive is excellent chopped and served in a salad,” says Kennedy. “Because of its firm texture, endive can be served in individual leaves with dip, or as a small roll-up.” Portion: 2 cups raw Calories: 10 Carbs: 2 g Fiber: 0.6 g Protein: 1 g [22] “Arugula has a strong, peppery flavor that some people can’t get enough of,” says Kennedy. “If this is you, it makes for a great salad all by itself. If the flavor is a bit strong for you, I’d recommend using it more as a condiment — adding a small amount to a salad or a few leaves on top of a sandwich.” Portion: 2 cups chopped Calories: 16 Carbs: 3 g Fiber: 1.4 g Protein: 1 g [23] Still, this crispy and inexpensive green doesn’t have to be removed from the menu entirely. “If it’s the only way you enjoy salad, or it’s what’s being offered at a dinner you’re attending, then go for it, and enjoy it as a nice contributor to your daily fluid needs,” says Kennedy. “However, if you like other, more nutrient-rich salad greens (and they’re available), you’d be better off nutritionally choosing one of those.” “Iceberg lettuce can be used just like butter lettuce (as a salad, on top of a sandwich, or as a bread replacement),” says Kennedy. “I don’t usually recommend iceberg lettuce because there’s not much nutritional value to it — I usually tell people to just have a glass of water instead.” Leafy salad greens are an excellent source of nutrition overall. They are particularly great sources of nitrates and several vitamins, including vitamin K, vitamin C, and some B vitamins. That said, not all salad greens are created equal. Your top options when it comes to nutrition include kale, spinach, beet greens and Swiss chard. Greens are easy to add to almost any meal, either as a sautéed side dish or as part of a salad, or even a sandwich topping. As with all foods, the key is to have a variety and balance, so try eating as many of these healthy, nutrition-dense vegetables as you can.

This cutlet recipe is the easiest appetiser which can be prepared in no time by following some simple steps. Wash the chicken, parboil it and shred it. In the meantime, take a pan and heat oil in it over medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds start to splutter, add chopped garlic and grated ginger. Fry until lightly golden. Make sure that the flame is on low so that the ginger and garlic don't burn. Once the raw flavour of garlic-ginger is gone, add chopped onions and sauté until soft. Wait for the onions to turn slightly translucent in colour. Then add finely chopped carrot and capsicum and saute for few minutes over a moderate-high flame. Take it off the heat, transfer it in a bowl and allow the mixture to cool for a while. In a large bowl, add boiled potatoes, shredded chicken, sauteed vegetable, green chillies, garam masala powder, oregano, cumin powder, bread crumbs, coriander leaves and mix well. Divide the mixture into equal lemon sized balls and shape each of them into a cutlet. Take each cutlet and coat it well with all-purpose flour. Then dip the cutlets in the beaten egg mixture and coat it with bread crumbs. Again dip the cutlet in the egg and then coat it with bread crumbs. Repeat the same for all. This step is important as it will give a crunchy texture to the cutlets. Place the cutlets on the tray lined with butter paper and freeze for 3-4 hours. Heat oil in a deep pan over medium flame and fry the cutlets until crisp and golden brown. Pair these delicious cutlets with some onion rings and serve them hot with ketchup, sauce or dip of your choice. Do try this recipe, rate it and let us know how it turned out to be. \n",
